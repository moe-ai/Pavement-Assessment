# Pavement Quality Assessment

I collaborated with UC Davis center of robotic to develop an efficient Deep Learning to assess and classify pavement distress.

In the first stage, the DL is implimented using an onboard lowcost laptop with a TPU unit and camera. This enables low cost real-time assessment of 1000 of kms and software warns the operator where further field data may be required.

Second stage of the project that is presented here uses google map street view images to develop assessment for kms of roadways that have not been assessed around The US.
